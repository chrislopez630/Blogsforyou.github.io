New York has an incarceration rate of 443 per 100,000 people, Which means it locks up more people then other wealthy democracies do. Over the last 5 years the incarceration rates has just rocketed from a handfull of inmates to a whole society of inmates. 

**Here is some bold text**

## Here is a secondary heading

| :------ |:--- | :--- |
| Five | Six | Four |
| Ten | Eleven | Nine |
| Seven | Eight | Six |
| Two | Three | One |


How about a yummy crepe?

![Crepe](https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cQ1Yoa75m2yUFFbY2xwuqw/348s.jpg)

It can also be centered!

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}
